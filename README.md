# Introduction üëã

Cabaigne is a PERN stack web application that helps (tourists | local) discover beaches in Tunisa.

The goal behind this app is to promote tunisian beaches (because we have awesome ones !!) to people around the world which can support tourism in our country and therefore help locals.

Cabaigne also provides informations related to the beach (entertainment options | safety | accessibility ...), real time sea state(calm | agitated | moderate), weather from [https://api.windy.com/](Windy API) and [https://openweathermap.org/](OpenWeather API)

## Back-End ‚öôÔ∏è:

The backend server and RESTFul API are written with expressjs. the database is postgresql and to communicate between them we use
Sequelize ORM.

We use JWT token for authentication

### routes üöà

- `/api/v1/beach/allbeaches`: extract all beaches with corresponding posts(eager loading) from database.
- `/api/v1/posts/allposts`:   extract all posts with corresponding user(eager loading) from database.
- `/api/v1/beach/newbeach`:   add new beach to database(only accessible by admins)
- `/api/v1/uploads/azureblopuploaduser`:  add azure image url to the corresponding user row.
- `/api/v1/uploads/azureblopuploadbeach`: add azure beach image url to the corresponding beach row.
- `/api/v1/user/allpinnedbeaches/:id`:  extract all beaches pinned by `:id`(id corresponds to user).

## Front-End üåê:

The front-End is written using ReactJS library, tailwind, Webpack to bundle all the javascript files and Babel for javascript compatibilty between all browsers.

We use `axios` for making requests to APIs (server and third parties).

## Cloud Deployment ‚òÅ

![infrastructure](images/infrastructure.png)

### Deployment Tools üõ†Ô∏è:

`github actions`: For our **CI/CD** pipeline we decided to go with github actions to automate the build, test and deployment process by writing workflows with `yaml` syntax in a `.github` folder inside the repo.

find backend tests workflow here [workflows](.github/workflows/integrate_backend.yml)
find deployment workflow here [workflows](.github/workflows/deployment-stage.yml)

`Azure blobstorage container`: out first option was to sotre all images on the filesystem but as we rebuild the docker images on each changes we decided to use azure blob storage to keep the data in separate place. It was a better choice as it separates the storage from the main server and by that out data will be secure in cases like server crashes or data loss.

`Azure PostgreSQL instance`: with the same mindset of separating the code from data, we decided to spin up a dedicated azure postgreSQL instance and link it to our main server. Doing this will distribute the load on two servers. One server will handle all the application processes - web interface and the Database server will handle all the database queries.

`Nginx`: as react built-in server is not suitable for production apps we use nginx web server. Nginx will manage all the requests and will pass it to the **application server** that is connected with a database server.

`Docker`: Docker containers holds dependencies and libraries that our application needs. therefore eliminate the need of installing dependencies manually. we were also able to create a separate dev and production environment. In the DEV environment we create a container for the Front-End, another for Back-End and the last one for postgreSQL while we only need the first 2 containers in the production and add nginx service to the Front-End. view our [docker-compose production file](docker-compose.prod.yml) [docker-compose development file](docker-compose.dev.yml).

## Run üîå:

Make sure to have docker installed on your system

* Clone the repository
* run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`
* access `http://localhost:3010` to interact with the application `localhost:3001` for the API and ``localhost:5432` for the database

## Disclaimer‚ùó

do not use any real informations emails |passwords!! the app is still in development and lacks security testing.
