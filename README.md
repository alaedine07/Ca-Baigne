# Introduction üëã

Cabaigne is a web application developed with PERN stack, that offers tourists and local beachgoers informations related to beaches in Tunisia <img src='./Readme-images/tn.png' width='20'>
<br>
We provide a list of Amenities , Real time sea state (Calm, moderate or Agitated) and current weather report.

The purpose behind developing our application is to give tourists and locals a service for finding their perfect beach and therefore promote Tunisian spots and support tourism industry.

## Cloud Deployment ‚òÅ

![infrastructure](Readme-images/deployment.png)

### Deployment Tools üõ†Ô∏è:

`github actions`: For our **CI/CD** pipeline we doad on two servers. One server will handle all the application processes - web interface and the Database server will handle all the database queries.

find Back-end tests workflow here [workflows](.github/workflows/integrate_backend.yml).
find Deployment workflow here [workflows](.github/workflows/deployment-stage.yml).

`Azure blobstorage container`: Our first option was to store all images on the filesystem but as we rebuild the docker images on each changes we decided to use azure blob storage to keep the data in separate place. It was a better choice as it separates the storage from the main server and by that ort data will be secure in cases the server crashes or data gets lost.

`Azure PostgreSQL instance`: With the same mindset of separating the code from data, we decided to spin up a dedicated azure postgreSQL instance and link it to our main server. Doing this will distribute the load on two servers. One server will handle all the application processes - web interface and the Database server will handle all the database queries.

`Nginx`: As react built-in server is not suitable for production apps we use nginx web server. Nginx will manage all the requests and will pass it to the **application server** that is connected to a database server.

`Docker`: Docker containers holds dependencies and libraries that our application needs. therefore eliminate the need of installing dependencies manually. we were also able to create a separate development and production environments. In the development environment we created a container for the Front-End, another for Back-End and the last one for postgreSQL while we only need the first 2 containers in the production and add nginx service to the Front-End. view our [docker-compose production file](docker-compose.prod.yml) [docker-compose development file](docker-compose.dev.yml).

## Run üîå:

Make sure to have docker installed on your system

* Clone the repository
* run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`
* access `http://localhost:3010` to interact with the application `localhost:3001` for the API and `localhost:5432` for the database.

## Disclaimer‚ùó

Do not use any real informations like Email adresses, Passwords, etc because the app is still under development and lacks security testing.
